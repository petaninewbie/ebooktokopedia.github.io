Among the most malicious DNS attacks would be the zone transfer. A zone is the data that maps :@0.117647:0.619312:0.881627:0.619312:0.881627:0.602539:0.117647:0.602539:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000
