What if we could send a continuous stream of packets telling the car to accelerate to 100 mph :@0.117647:0.416848:0.855941:0.416848:0.855941:0.400076:0.117647:0.400076:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000
